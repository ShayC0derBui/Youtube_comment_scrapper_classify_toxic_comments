# Youtube_comment_scrapper_classify_toxic_comments
This code scrapes a youtube video for its comments and we can do various classification or analyse that data

You can change time.sleep(_) parameter here with 3 seconds if you like, if the window closes before scrapes all the comments because of slow internet.

It takes 2.5 seconds to classify 1 comments with detoxify, so classifying 1000 comments may take 50 minutes...
